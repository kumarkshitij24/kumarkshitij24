__Hi__

I am a Software Engineer and a passionate UX Enthusiast. I like to work on front-end projects, mainly creating and coding a good user experience page. Currently, I am learning shaders for making 3d interactions on web using webgl. I am also an upcoming Associate Software Engineer at Accenture.
